# Testing Workflow for Speedy Delivery

## Test Types
1. **Clean Test** (`test/clean-test.sh`) - Comprehensive installation testing in isolated environment
2. **Smoke Test** (`test/smoke-test.sh`) - Functional demonstration with real file watching
3. **Basic Tests** (`test/test_speedy_delivery.sh`) - Core functionality verification

## Testing Patterns
- Create temporary directories with unique names: `/tmp/speedy-test-$$`
- Implement cleanup functions with `trap cleanup EXIT`
- Use color-coded output for test results
- Test both success and failure scenarios
- Verify file creation, process management, and cleanup

## Makefile Targets
- `make test-clean` - Run comprehensive installation tests
- `make smoke-test` - Demonstrate functionality with real file watching
- `make lint` - Check script syntax
- `make clean` - Remove test artifacts and cache
- `make help` - Show available targets

## Test Environment Setup
- Copy project files to isolated directory
- Make scripts executable
- Set up cleanup traps
- Use `set +e` for testing to handle expected failures
- Implement proper error handling and reporting

## Validation Points
- Script syntax validation
- File presence checks
- Help functionality testing
- Makefile target verification
- Installation script logic testing
- Process management testing
- Log file creation verification
- Cache directory creation checks
